# mealmaker

mealmaker is a novel way in which one can plan healthy meals for themselves without moving more than a muscle. 

By using Google Cloud's vision API, one can simply take a photo of the groceries they may have just bought or those that they want to make a meal out of, upload it to our app, and it will give you recommendations for healthy recipes to try out from Edamam's nutrition API. 

These recommendations would include specific protein, carbohydrate, and fat breakdowns in order to transparently and seamlessly integrate quality with respect to both the ratings of the recipes themselves and the heartiness of the food itself. 

In that way, users will have the ability to rapidly plan the best meals for their health with the materials that they have in the palm of their hand.
